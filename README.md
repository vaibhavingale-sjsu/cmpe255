## Ethylene and Methane Detection using Machine Learning
This project uses machine learning to detect the presence of ethylene and methane in a gas mixture. The 

project is divided into two parts:

1. Data preprocessing
2. Model training and evaluation


## Data preprocessing
The first step is to preprocess the data. 

This involves:

1. Reading the data from a CSV file
2. Dropping any rows with missing values
3. Splitting the data into training and test sets
4. Standardizing the features

## Model training and evaluation

Once the data has been preprocessed, we can train and evaluate a model. 

We will use a variety of machine learning models, including:

- Linear discriminant analysis (LDA)
- Quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA)
- Logistic regression

We have evaluated each model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Results
The best performing model is Logistic Regression, with an accuracy of 94% on the test set.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of machine learning to detect the presence of ethylene and methane in a gas mixture. The results show that LDA is a promising model for this task.
